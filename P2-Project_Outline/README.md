## Submission Instructions

### Overview
**PBX** is a web application that offers users the ability to document a distinct creative happening that will be submitted to a searchable archive made accessible to all members of the group that the user is working with. With this functionality, a user has the ability to freely associate these creative happenings with others, by suggesting ways to augment or connect ideas with archived items submitted by users via a formatted personal message. This app is intended to fill a niche that offers the social functionality of a blog or social media platform, but creates a less ephemeral, design intrusive & business/marketing-centric way to communicate with other users, and focuses on ideas that are developed independently of social expectation — In short, this is a documentation & collaboration tool, not a form of entertainment &/or advertising.  

After creating and logging into their account, the user’s home screen will present the following options: on the left side of the screen is a vertical menu, in which the user may submit a document, visit the searchable archive, generate a random document (made visible in the right-center of the screen with it’s photo avatar), or check their personal messages (which are the suggested amendments to an item in the user’s archive, submitted by another user in the group). The intended “content” for this application are distinct “creative happenings” — which I’ll define as a spontaneous creative fragment, executed in any variety of media, that stands alone as a distinct moment, but can be freely associated with other material to create a more complex whole, leaving a visual representation of the web of inspiration in it’s trail.  

This application is inspired by the way a contemporary artist or musician might formally document an abstract creative experience, thus elevating the raw inspiration to the same level of importance that a marketable product or a published academic piece.  The random feature on the user’s homepage is inspired by Oblique Strategies, but instead of a written suggestion to navigate a creative block, you can respond directly to your past work or the work of your peers, generating a wellspring of creative momentum within the group.

### What I'll Have to Learn
Although I want this project to have minimal design, I plan to learn & incorporate CSS/Javascript to smooth the edges and give the design a coherent and sturdy look. A foreseeable amendment is to include some analytics on the user page to have some data associated with the work done by the group to help complete projects. For instance, you could a item and frequency read on peotry submissions by the group, you could plan to assemble them into a collection & estimate the amount of time that may take.
